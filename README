To accomplish the bonus task, spring security is imported
A in memory user is created for testing purpose (rate limit for the authorized user and unauthorized user)
The user information is as follow (Basic Auth):
username: user
password: password

To build the docker image, please run as follow
1. gradlew bootJar
2. docker build -t takehome:0.0.1 .
3. docker run --publish 8080:8080 takehome:0.0.1

(P.S. I tried on Windows that the distributionUrl in gradle-wrapper.properties need to change to version 8.0.2 for Spring 3.0.5)
